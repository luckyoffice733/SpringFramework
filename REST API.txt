API -> Application Programming Interface:
-----------------------------------------
The main objective of API is two applications can communicate with each other. 
API allows external agent to communicate (integrate and exchange information) with our application.
In Simple way: 'Methods of communication between software components'

Eg1: By using API a java application can communicate with python application.
Book my show application can communicate with Payment gateway application to complete our booking.


Web API/Web Service:
----------------------
The interface of communication between the user and application over the web by using 
HTTP is nothing but Web API.


REST: Representational State Transfer:
--------------------------------------
Representational State Transfer(REST) is an architectural style.

It defines several Rules/Guide Lines to develop Web APIs/Web Services By using REST, we can develop web APIs very easily in concise way.

Hence REST is the most popular Architecture to develop Web Services.


Restful API:
------------
The API which is developed by using REST Architecture is nothing but Restful API. 
i.e. interface between the user and application where API implements REST Architecture.


HTTP METHODS:
-----------
HTTP Methods represent the type of operation what we required.

Based on requirement we have to use the corresponding HTTP verb.

The following are various HTTP Verbs
1) GET -> To get one/more existing resources
2) POST -> To create a new resource
3) PUT -> To update an existing resource like update all fields of employee
4) PATCH -> To perform partial updating of an existing resource like updating only salary 
of employee
5) DELETE -> To delete an existing resource.

HTTP Verbs vs Database CRUD Operations:
-----------------------------------------
C (CREATE) -> POST
R (RETRIEVE/READ) -> GET
U (UPDATE) -> PUT/PATCH
D (DELETE) -> DELETE


Status Codes:
-------------
Status code represents the status of HTTP Response. The following are various possible 
status codes.

1XX -> Informational
2XX -> Successful
3XX -> Redirection
4XX -> Client Error
5XX -> Server Error
